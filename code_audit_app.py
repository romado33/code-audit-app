You are a senior software architect and security expert. Analyze the following code and provide an audit report with scores from 0 to 10 for each of these categories:

1. Security
2. Logic Correctness
3. Performance
4. Scalability
5. Reusability / Modularity
6. Readability / Maintainability
7. Testability
8. Best Practices / Modernity
9. AI-Generated Code Smells

For each, include a 1-2 sentence explanation.

Then give an Overall Code Health Score and a short summary.
